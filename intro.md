Here is what I found as a good definition from Oxford, via Wikipedia:

> __Analytics__ is "the systematic computational analysis of data or statistics."

To me, an analytics solution could be as simple as a distance matrix printed at the bottom of a map. That is indeed one of the first experiences with data that I recall from my childhood. Or as sophisticated as a real-time system for detection and monitoring of signals and/or prediction of target variables.
